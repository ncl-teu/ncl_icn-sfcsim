# ncl_icn-sfcsim
- icn-sfcsim is a simulator for service function chaining(SFC) using workflow scheduling on ICN. 
- This simulator supports several SF(Service Function) scheduling algorithms, and you can add a new algorithm in it. 
- Resultant execution information is written to a log file, and you can analyze the behaviors of the process. 

# How to build/run
- If you have already installed `ant` type `ant build` at the $PROJECT_HOME. 
## Master-Worker ICN Mode
- A CCNNode generates SFC and send the request to the master node. Then the master node schedules according to `master.properties`. 
- Then every SF (Service Function) is assigned to a vCPU ID and the interest packet for the END SF is sent to the node in which the vCPU is allocated to the END SF. 
- As for executing the simulator, type `./mastermain.sh` for Linux, or double click `mastermain.bat` for windows. 
- For how to develop a new SFC scheduling algorithm, see [here](https://github.com/ncl-teu/ncl_sfcsim#how-to-create-a-new-sfc-schduling-algorithm-for-list-based-scheduling)
## Autonomous ICN Mode
- As for executing the simulator, type `./automain.sh` for Linux, or double click `automain.bat` for windows. 
# About log format. 
- There are two types of log file, i.e., `is/islog.csv` and `is/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss.csv`.
- is/islog.csv format:
